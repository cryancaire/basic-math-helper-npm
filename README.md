## What is this?
A small package with some basic math helper functions.

## How do I install?
Easy! Just run `npm install basic-math-helper`

`import { add, subtract, multiply, divide, random } from 'basic-math-helper`

`console.log(add(5,5))`


## Parameters
The add, subtract, multiply and random functions all accept integers as parameters.

`random(min,max)` the min defaults to 1, and max defaults to 100.

The divide function can accept 3 parameters. `divide(num1, num2, round)` round defaults to false but if you want to round the number, set that to true.
